# You Don't Know JS Yet: Types & Grammar - 2nd Edition
# Chapter 4: Coercing Values

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| Work in progress |

We've thouroughly covered all of the different *types* of values in JS. And along the way, more than a few times, we mentioned the notion of converting -- actually, coercing -- from one type of value to another.

In this chapter, we'll dive deep into coercion and uncover all its mysteries.

## Coercion: Explicit vs Implicit

Some developers assert that when you explicitly indicate a type change in an operation, this doesn't qualify as a *coercion* but just a type-cast or type-conversion. In other words, the claim is that coercion is only implicit.

I disagree with this characterization. I use *coercion* to label any type conversion in a dynamically-typed language, whether it's plainly obvious in the code or not. Here's why: the line between *explicit* and *implicit* is not clear and objective, it's fairly subjective. If you think a type conversion is implicit (and thus *coercion*), but I think it's explicit (and thus not a *coercion*), the distinction becomes irrelevant.

Keep that subjectivity in mind as we explore various *explicit* and *implicit* forms of coercion. In fact, here's a spoiler: most of the coercions could be argued as either, so we'll be looking at them with such balanced perspective.

### Implicit: Bad or ...?

An extremely common opinion among JS developers is that *coercion is bad*, specifically, that *implicit coercion is bad*; the rise in popularity of type-aware tooling like TypeScript speaks loudly to this sentiment.

But that feeling is not new. 14+ years ago, Douglas Crockford's book "The Good Parts" also famously decried *implicit coercion* as one of the *bad parts*. Even Brendan Eich, creator of JS, regularly claims that *implicit coercion* was a mistake[^EichCoercion] in the early design of the language that he now regrets.

If you've been around JS for more than a few months, you've almost certainly heard these opinions voiced strongly and predominantly. And if you've been around JS for years or more, you probably have your mind already made up.

In fact, I think you'd be hard pressed to name hardly any other well-known source of JS teaching that strongly endorses coercion (in virtually all its forms); I do -- and this book definitely does! -- but I feel mostly like a lone voice shouting futilely in the wilderness.

However, here's an observation I've made over the years: most of the folks who publicly condemn *implicit coercion*, actually use *implicit coercion* in their own code. Hmmmm...

Douglas Crockford says to avoid the mistake of *implicit coercion*[^CrockfordCoercion], but his code uses `if (..)` statements with non-boolean values evaluated. [^CrockfordIfs] Many have dismissed my pointing that out in the past, with the claim that `ToBoolean()` isn't *really* coercion. Ummm... ok?

Brendan Eich says he regrets *implicit coercion*, but yet he openly endorses[^BrendanToString] idioms like `x + ""` (and others!) to coerce the value in `x` to a string (we'll cover this later); and that's most definitely an *implicit coercion*.

So what do we make of this dissonance? Is it merely a, "do as I say, not as I do" minor self-contradiction? Or is there more to it?

I am not going to pass a final judgement here yet, but I want you the reader to deeply ponder that question, as you continue throughout this chapter and book.

## Abstracts

Now that I've challenged you to examine coercion in more depth than you may have ever previously indulged, let's first look at the foundations of how coercion occurs, according to the JS specification.

The specification details a number of *abstract operations*[^AbstractOperations] that dictate internal conversion from one value-type to another. It's important to be aware of these operations, as coercive mechanics in the language mix and match them in various ways.

These operations *look* as if they're real functions that could be called, such as `ToString(..)` or `ToNumber(..)`. But by *abstract*, we mean they only exist conceptually by these names; they aren't functions we can *directly* invoke in our programs. Instead, we activate them implicitly/indirectly depending on the statements/expressions in our programs.

### ToBoolean

Decision making (conditional branching) always requires a boolean `true` or `false` value. But it's extremely common to want to make these decisions based on non-boolean value conditions, such as whether a string is empty or has anything in it.

When non-boolean values are encountered in a context that requires a boolean -- such as the condition clause of an `if` statement or `for` loop -- the `ToBoolean(..)`[^ToBoolean] abstract operation is activated to facilitate the coercion.

All values in JS are in one of two buckets: *truthy* or *falsy*. Truthy values coerce via the `ToBoolean()` operation to `true`, whereas falsy values coerce to `false`:

```
// ToBoolean() is abstract

ToBoolean(undefined);               // false
ToBoolean(null);                    // false
ToBoolean("");                      // false
ToBoolean(0);                       // false
ToBoolean(-0);                      // false
ToBoolean(0n);                      // false
ToBoolean(NaN);                     // false
```

Simple rule: *any other value* that's not in the above list is truthy and coerces via `ToBoolean()` to `true`:

```
ToBoolean("hello");                 // true
ToBoolean(42);                      // true
ToBoolean([ 1, 2, 3 ]);             // true
ToBoolean({ a: 1 });                // true
```

Even values like `"   "` (string with only whitespace), `[]` (empty array), and `{}` (empty object), which may seem intuitively like they're more "false" than "true", nevertheless coerce to `true`.

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| There *are* narrow, tricky exceptions to this truthy rule. For example, the web platform has deprecated the long-standing `document.all` collection/array feature, though it cannot be removed entirely -- that would break too many sites. Even where `document.all` is still defined, it behaves as a "falsy object"[^ExoticFalsyObjects] -- `undefined` which then coerces to `false`; this means legacy conditional checks like `if (document.all) { .. }` no longer pass. |

The `ToBoolean()` coercion operation is basically a lookup table rather than an algorithm of steps to use in coercions a non-boolean to a boolean. Thus, some developers assert that this isn't *really* coercion the way other abstract coercion operations are. I think that's bogus. `ToBoolean()` converts from non-boolean value-types to a boolean, and that's clear cut type coercion (even if it's a very simple lookup instead of an algorithm).

Keep in mind: these rules of boolean coercion only apply when `ToBoolean()` is actually activated. There are constructs/idioms in the JS language that may appear to involve boolean coercion but which don't actually do so.

### ToPrimitive

Any value that's not already a primitive can be reduced to a primitive using the `ToPrimitive()` (specifically, `OrdinaryToPrimitive()`[^OrdinaryToPrimitive]) abstract operation.  Generally, the `ToPrimitive()` is given a *hint* to tell it whether a `number` or `string` is preferred.

```
// ToPrimitive() is abstract

ToPrimitive({ a: 1 },"string");          // "[object Object]"

ToPrimitive({ a: 1 },"number");          // NaN
```

The `ToPrimitive()` operation will look on the object provided, for either a `toString()` method or a `valueOf()` method; the order it looks for those is controlled by the *hint*. `"string"` means check in `toString()` / `valueOf()` order, whereas `"number"` (or no *hint*) means check in `valueOf()` / `toString()` order.

If the method returns a value matching the *hinted* type, the operation is finished. But if the method doesn't return a value of the *hinted* type, `ToPrimitive()` will then look for and invoke the other method (if found).

If the attempts at method invocation fail to produce a value of the *hinted* type, the final return value is forcibly coerced via the corresponding abstract operation: `ToString()` or `ToNumber()`.

### ToString

Pretty much any value that's not already a string can be coerced to a string representation, via `ToString()`. [^ToString] This is usually quite intuitive, especially with primitive values:

```
// ToString() is abstract

ToString(42.0);                 // "42"
ToString(-3);                   // "-3"
ToString(Infinity);             // "Infinity"
ToString(NaN);                  // "NaN"
ToString(42n);                  // "42"

ToString(true);                 // "true"
ToString(false);                // "false"

ToString(null);                 // "null"
ToString(undefined);            // "undefined"
```

There are *some* results that may vary from common intuition. As mentioned in Chapter 2, very large or very small numbers will be represented using scientific notation:

```
ToString(Number.MAX_VALUE);     // "1.7976931348623157e+308"
ToString(Math.EPSILON);         // "2.220446049250313e-16"
```

Another counter-intuitive result comes from `-0`:

```
ToString(-0);                   // "0" -- wtf?
```

This isn't a bug, it's just an intentional behavior from the earliest days of JS, based on the assumption that developers generally wouldn't want to ever see a negative-zero output.

One primitive value-type that is *not allowed* to be coerced (implicitly, at least) to string is `symbol`:

```
ToString(Symbol("ok"));         // TypeError exception thrown
```

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| Calling the `String()`[^StringFunction] concrete function (without `new` operator) is generally thought of as *merely* invoking the `ToString()` abstract operation. While that's mostly true, it's not entirely so. `String(Symbol("ok"))` works, whereas the abstract `ToString(Symbol(..))` itself throws an exception. More on `String(..)` later in this chapter. |

#### Default `toString()`

When `ToString()` is activated with an object value-type, it delegates to the `ToPrimitive()` operation (as explained earlier), with `"string"` as its *hinted* type:

```
ToString(new String("abc"));        // "abc"
ToString(new Number(42));           // "42"

ToString({ a: 1 });                 // "[object Object]"
ToString([ 1, 2, 3 ]);              // "1,2,3"
```

By virtue of `ToPrimitive(..,"string")` delegation, these objects all have their default `toString()` method (inherited via `[[Prototype]]`) invoked.

### ToNumber

Non-number values *that resemble* numbers, such as numeric strings, can generally be coerced to a numeric representation, using `ToNumber()`: [^ToNumber]

```
// ToNumber() is abstract

ToNumber("42");                     // 42
ToNumber("-3");                     // -3
ToNumber("1.2300");                 // 1.23
ToNumber("   8.0    ");             // 8
```

If the full value doesn't *completely* (other than whitespace) resemble a valid number, the result will be `NaN`:

```
ToNumber("123px");                  // NaN
ToNumber("hello");                  // NaN
```

Other primitive values have certain designated numeric equivalents:

```
ToNumber(true);                     // 1
ToNumber(false);                    // 0

ToNumber(null);                     // 0
ToNumber(undefined);                // NaN
```

There are some rather surprising designations for `ToNumber()`:

```
ToNumber("");                       // 0
ToNumber("       ");                // 0
```

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| I call these "surprising" because I think it would have made much more sense for them to coerce to `NaN`, the way `undefined` does. |

Some primitive values are *not allowed* to be coerced to numbers, and result in exceptions rather than `NaN`:

```
ToNumber(42n);                      // TypeError exception thrown
ToNumber(Symbol("42"));             // TypeError exception thrown
```

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| Calling the `Number()`[^NumberFunction] concrete function (without `new` operator) is generally thought of as *merely* invoking the `ToNumber()` abstract operation to coerce a value to a number. While that's mostly true, it's not entirely so. `Number(42n)` works, whereas the abstract `ToNumber(42n)` itself throws an exception. |

#### Other Abstract Numeric Conversions

In addition to `ToNumber()`, the specification defines `ToNumeric()`, which activates `ToPrimitive()` on a value, then conditionally delegates to `ToNumber()` if the value is *not* already a `bigint` value-type.

There are also a wide variety of abstract operations related to converting values to very specific subsets of the general `number` type:

* `ToIntegerOrInfinity()`
* `ToInt32()`
* `ToUint32()`
* `ToInt16()`
* `ToUint16()`
* `ToInt8()`
* `ToUint8()`
* `ToUint8Clamp()`

Other operations related to `bigint`:

* `ToBigInt()`
* `StringToBigInt()`
* `ToBigInt64()`
* `ToBigUint64()`

You can probably infer the purpose of these operations from their names, and/or from consulting their algorithms in the specification. For most JS operations, it's more likely that a higher-level operation like `ToNumber()` is activated, rather than these specific ones.

#### Default `valueOf()`

When `ToNumber()` is activated on an object value-type, it instead delegates to the `ToPrimitive()` operation (as explained earlier), with `"number"` as its *hinted* type:

```
ToNumber(new String("abc"));        // NaN
ToNumber(new Number(42));           // 42

ToNumber({ a: 1 });                 // NaN
ToNumber([ 1, 2, 3 ]);              // NaN
ToNumber([]);                       // 0
```

By virtue of `ToPrimitive(..,"number")` delegation, these objects all have their default `valueOf()` method (inherited via `[[Prototype]]`) invoked.

### Equality Comparison

When JS needs to determine if two values are the *same value*, it activates the `SameValue()`[^SameValue] operation, which delegates to a variety of related sub-operations.

This operation is very narrow and strict, and performs no coercion or any other special case exceptions. If two values are *exactly* the same, the result is `true`, otherwise it's `false`:

```
// SameValue() is abstract

SameValue("hello","\x68ello");          // true
SameValue("\u{1F4F1}","\uD83D\uDCF1");  // true
SameValue(42,42);                       // true
SameValue(NaN,NaN);                     // true

SameValue("\u00e9","\u0065\u0301");     // false
SameValue(0,-0);                        // false
SameValue([1,2,3],[1,2,3]);             // false
```

A variation of these operations is `SameValueZero()` and its associated sub-operations. The main difference is that these operations treat `0` and `-0` as indistinguishable.

```
// SameValueZero() is abstract

SameValueZero(0,-0);                    // true
```

If the values are numeric (`number` or `bigint`), `SameValue()` and `SameValueZero()` both delegate to sub-operations of the same names, specialized for each `number` and `bigint` type, respectively.

Otherwise, `SameValueNonNumeric()` is the sub-operation delegated to if the values being compared are both non-numeric:

```
// SameValueNonNumeric() is abstract

SameValueNonNumeric("hello","hello");   // true

SameValueNonNumeric([1,2,3],[1,2,3]);   // false
```

#### Higher-Abstracted Equality

Different from `SameValue()` and its variations, the specification also defines two important higher-abstraction abstract equality comparison operations:

* `IsStrictlyEqual()`[^StrictEquality]
* `IsLooselyEqual()`[^LooseEquality]

The `IsStrictlyEqual()` operation immediately returns `false` if the value-types being compared are different.

If the value-types are the same, `IsStrictlyEqual()` delegates to sub-operations for comparing `number` or `bigint` values. [^NumericAbstractOps] You might logically expect these delegated sub-operations to be the aforementioned numeric-specialized `SameValue()` / `SameValueZero()` operations. However, `IsStrictlyEqual()` instead delegates to `Number:equal()`[^NumberEqual] or `BigInt:equal()`[^BigIntEqual].

The difference between `Number:SameValue()` and `Number:equal()` is that the latter defines corner cases for `0` vs `-0` comparison:

```
// all of these are abstract operations

Number:SameValue(0,-0);             // false
Number:SameValueZero(0,-0);         // true
Number:equal(0,-0);                 // true
```

These operations also differ in `NaN` vs `NaN` comparison:

```
Number:SameValue(NaN,NaN);          // true
Number:equal(NaN,NaN);              // false
```

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| So in other words, despite its name, `IsStrictlyEqual()` is not quite as "strict" as `SameValue()`, in that it *lies* when comparisons of `-0` or `NaN` are involved. |

The `IsLooselyEqual()` operation also inspects the value-types being compared; if they're the same, it immediately delegates to `IsStrictlyEqual()`.

But if the value-types being compared are different, `IsLooselyEqual()` performs a variety of *coercive equality* steps. It's important to note that this algorithm is always trying to reduce the comparison down to where both value-types are the same (and it tends to prefer `number` / `bigint`).

The steps of the *coercive equality* portion of the algorithm can roughly be summarized as follows:

1. If either value is `null` and the other is `undefined`, `IsLooselyEqual()` returns `true`. In other words, this algorithm applies *nullish* equality, in that `null` and `undefined` are coercively equal to each other (and to no other values).

2. If either value is a `number` and the other is a `string`, the `string` value is coerced to a `number` via `ToNumber()`.

3. If either value is a `bigint` and the other is a `string`, the `string` value is coerced to a `bigint` via `StringToBigInt()`.

4. If either value is a `boolean`, it's coerced to a `number`.

5. If either value is a non-primitive (object, etc), it's coerced to a primitive with `ToPrimitive()`; though a *hint* is not explicitly provided, the default behavior will be as if `"number"` was the hint.

Each time a coercion is performed in the above steps, the algorithm is *recursively* reactivated with the new value(s). That process continues until the types are the same, and then the comparison is delegated to the `IsStrictlyEqual()` operation.

What can we take from this algorithm? First, we see there is a bias toward `number` (or `bigint`) comparison; it nevers coerce values to `string` or `boolean` value-types.

Importantly, we see that both `IsLooselyEqual()` and `IsStrictlyEqual()` are type-sensitive. `IsStrictlyEqual()` immediately bails if the types mismatch, whereas `IsLooselyEqual()` performs the extra work to coerce mismatching value-types to be the same value-types (again, ideally, `number` or `bigint`).

Moreover, if/once the types are the same, both operations are identical -- `IsLooselyEqual()` delegates to `IsStrictlyEqual()`.

### Relational Comparison

When values are compared relationally -- that is, is one value "less than" another? -- there's one specific abstract operation that is activated: `IsLessThan()`. [^LessThan]

```
// IsLessThan() is abstract

IsLessThan(1,2, /*LeftFirst=*/ true );            // true
```

There is no `IsGreaterThan()` operation; instead, the first two arguments to `IsLessThan()` can be reversed to accomplish a "greater than" comparison. To preserve left-to-right evaluation semantics (in the case of nuanced side-effects), `isLessThan()` also takes a third argument (`LeftFirst`); if `false`, this indicates a comparison was reversed and the second parameter should be evaluated before the first.

```
IsLessThan(1,2, /*LeftFirst=*/ true );            // true

// equivalent of a fictional "IsGreaterThan()"
IsLessThan(2,1, /*LeftFirst=*/ false );          // false
```

Similar to `IsLooselyEqual()`, the `IsLessThan()` operation is *coercive*, meaning that it first ensures that the value-types of its two values match, and prefers numeric comparisons. There is no `IsStrictLessThan()` for non-coercive relational comparison.

As an example of coercive relational comparison, if the type of one value is `string` and the type of the other is `bigint`, the `string` is coerced to a `bigint` with the aforementioned `StringToBigInt()` operation. Once the types are the same, `IsLessThan()` proceeds as described in the following sections.

#### String Comparison

When both value are type `string`, `IsLessThan()` checks to see if the lefthand value is a prefix (the first *n* characters[^StringPrefix]) of the righthand; if so, `true` is returned.

If neither string is a prefix of the other, the first character position (start-to-end direction, not left-to-right) that's different between the two strings, is compared for their respective code-unit (numeric) values; the result is then returned.

Generally, code-units follow intuitive lexicographic (aka, dictionary) order:

```
IsLessThan("a","b", /*LeftFirst=*/ true );        // true
```

Even digits are treated as characters (not numbers):

```
IsLessThan("101","12", /*LeftFirst=*/ true );     // true
```

There's even a bit of embedded *humor* in the unicode code-unit ordering:

```
IsLessThan("🐔","🥚", /*LeftFirst=*/ true );      // true
```

At least now we've answered the age old question of *which comes first*?!

#### Numeric Comparison

For numeric comparisons, `IsLessThan()` defers to either the `Number:lessThan()` or `BigInt.lessThan()` operation[^NumericAbstractOps], respectively:

```
IsLessThan(41,42, /*LeftFirst=*/ true );         // true

IsLessThan(-0,0, /*LeftFirst=*/ true );          // false

IsLessThan(NaN,1 /*LeftFirst=*/ true );          // false

IsLessThan(41n,42n, /*LeftFirst=*/ true );       // true
```

## Concrete Coercions

Now that we've covered all the abstract operations JS defines for handling various coercions, it's time to turn our attention to the concrete statements/expressions we can use in our programs that activate these operations.

### To Boolean

To coerce a value that's not of type `boolean` into that type, we need the abstract `ToBoolean()` operation, as described earlier in this chapter.

Before we explore *how* to activate it, let's discuss *why* you would want to force a `ToBoolean()` coercion.

From a code readability perspective, being *explicit* about type coercions can be preferable (though not universally). But functionally, the most common reason to force a `boolean` is when you're passing data to an external source -- for example, submitting data as JSON to an API endpoint -- and that location expects `true` / `false` without needing to do coercions.

There's several ways that `ToBoolean()` can be activated. Perhaps the most *explicit* (obvious) is the `Boolean(..)` function:

```js
Boolean("hello");               // true
Boolean(42);                    // true

Boolean("");                    // false
Boolean(0);                     // false
```

As mentioned in Chapter 3, keep in mind that `Boolean(..)` is being called without the `new` keyword, to activate the `ToBoolean()` abstract operation.

It's not terribly common to see JS developers use the `Boolean(..)` function for such explicit coercions. More often, developers will use the double-`!` idiom:

```js
!!"hello";                      // true
!!42;                           // true

!!"";                           // false
!!0;                            // false
```

The `!!` is not its own operator, even though it seems that way. It's actually two usages of the unary `!` operator. This operator first coerces any non-`boolean`, then negates it. To undo the negation, the second `!` flips it back.

So... which of the two, `Boolean(..)` or `!!`, do you consider to be more of an explicit coercion?

Given the flipping that `!` does, which must then be undone with another `!`, I'd say `Boolean(..)` is *more* explicit -- at the job of coercing a non-`boolean` to a `boolean` -- than `!!` is. But surveying open-source JS code, the `!!` is used far more often.

If we're defining *explicit* as, "most directly and obviously perfoming an action", `Boolean(..)` edges out `!!`. But if we're defining *explicit* as, "most recognizably performing an action", `!!` might have the edge. Is there a definitive answer here?

While you're pondering that question, let's look at another JS mechanism that activates `ToBoolean()` under the covers:

```js
specialNumber = 42;

if (specialNumber) {
    // ..
}
```

The `if` statement requires a `boolean` for the conditional to make its control-flow decision. If you pass it a non-`boolean`, a `ToBoolean()` *coercion* is performed.

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| Many other statement types also activate the `ToBoolean()` coercion, including the `? :` ternary, and `for` / `while` loops. |

Is `if (..)` here illustrating an *explicit* coercion or an *implicit* coercion? Again, I think it depends on your perspective. The specification dictates pretty explicitly that `if` only works with `boolean` conditional values. But a strong argument can be made that any coercion is a secondary effect to the main job of `if`, which is to make a control-flow decision.

In fact, as mentioned earlier in the `ToBoolean()` discussion, some developers don't consider *any* invocation of `ToBoolean()` to be a coercion. But I think that's too much of a stretch.

My take: `Boolean(..)` is the most preferable *explicit* coercion form. Further, I think `if` / `for` / `while` statements are *implicitly* coercing non-`boolean`s, but I'm OK with that.

Since most developers, including famous names like Doug Crockford, also in practice use implicit (`boolean`) coercions in their `if`[^CrockfordIfs] and loop statements, I think we can say that at least *some forms* of *implicit* coercion are widely acceptable, regardless of the rhetoric to the contrary.

### To String

As with `ToBoolean()`, there are a number of ways to activate the `ToString()` coercion (as discussed earlier in the chapter). The decision of which approach is similarly subjective.

Like the `Boolean(..)` function, the `String(..)` function (no `new` keyword) is a primary way of activating *explicit* `ToString()` coercion:

```js
String(true);                   // "true"
String(42);                     // "42"
String(-0);                     // "0"
String(Infinity);               // "Infinity"

String(null);                   // "null"
String(undefined);              // "undefined"
```

However, `String(..)` is more than *just* an activation of `ToString()`. For example:

```js
String(Symbol("ok"));           // "Symbol(ok)"
```

This works, because *explicit* coercion of `symbol` values is allowed. But in cases where a symbol is *implicitly* coerced to a string (e.g., `Symbol("ok") + ""`), the underlying `ToString()` operation throws an exception. That proves that `String(..)` is more than just an activation of `ToString()`. More on *implicit* string coercion of symbols in a bit.

If you call `String(..)` with an object value (e.g., array, etc), it activates the `ToPrimitive()` operation (via the `ToString()` operation), which then looks for an invokes that value's `toString()` method:

```js
String([1,2,3]);                // "1,2,3"

String(x => x + 1);             // "x => x + 1"
```

Aside from `String(..)`, any primitive, non-nullish value (neither `null` nor `undefined`) can be auto-boxed (see Chapter 3) in its respective object wrapper, providing a callable `toString()` method.

```js
true.toString();                // "true"
42..toString();                 // "42"
-0..toString();                 // "0"
Infinity.toString();            // "Infinity"
Symbol("ok").toString();        // "Symbol(ok)"
```

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| Do keep in mind, these `toString()` methods do *not* necessarily activate the `ToString()` operation, they just define their own rules for how to represent the value as a string. |

As shown with `String(..)` just a moment ago, the various object sub-types -- such as arrays, functions, regular expressions, `Date` and `Error` instances, etc -- all define their own specific `toString()` methods, which can be invoked directly:

```js
[1,2,3].toString();             // "1,2,3"

(x => x + 1).toString();        // "x => x + 1"
```

Moreover, any plain object that's (by default) `[[Prototype]]` linked to `Object.prototype` has a default `toString()` method available:

```js
({ a : 1 }).toString();         // "[object Object]"
```

Is the `toString()` approach to coercion *explicit* or *implicit*? Again, it depends. It's certainly a self-descriptive mechanism, which leans *explicit*. But it often relies on auto-boxing, which is itself a fairly *implicit* coercion.

Let's take a look at another common -- and famously endorsed! -- idiom for coercing a value to a string. Recall from "String Concatenation" in Chapter 2, the `+` operator is overloaded to prefer string concatenation if either operand is already a string, and thus coerces non-string operand to a string if necessary.

Consider:

```js
true + "";                      // "true"
42 + "";                        // "42"
null + "";                      // "null"
undefined + "";                 // "undefined"
```

The `+ ""` idiom for string coercion takes advantage of the `+` overloading, without altering the final coerced string value. By the way, all of these work the same with the operands reversed (i.e., `"" + ..`).

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| An extremely common misconception is that `String(x)` and `x + ""` are basically equivalent coercions, respectively just *explicit* vs *implicit* in form. But, that's not quite true! We'll revisit this in the "To Primitive" section later in this chapter. |

Some feel this is an *explicit* coercion, but I think it's clearly more *implicit*, in that it's taking advantage of the `+` overloading; further, the `""` is indirectly used to activate the coercion without modifying it. Moreover, consider what happens when this idiom is applied with a symbol value:

```js
Symbol("ok") + "";              // TypeError exception thrown
```

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| Allowing *explicit* coercion of symbols (`String(Symbol("ok"))`, but disallowing *implicit* coercion (`Symbol("ok") + ""`), is quite intentional by TC39. [^SymbolString] It was felt that symbols, as primitives often used in places where strings are otherwise used, could too easily be mistaken as strings. As such, they wanted to make sure developers expressed intent to coerce a symbol to a string, hopefully avoiding many of those anticipated confusions. This is one of the *extremely rare* cases where the language design asserts an opinion on, and actually discriminates between, *explicit* vs. *implicit* coercions. |

Why the exception? JS treats `+ ""` as an *implicit* coercion, which is why when activated with a symbol, an exception is thrown. I think that's a pretty ironclad proof.

Nevertheless, as I mentioned at the start of this chapter, Brendan Eich endorses `+ ""`[^BrendanToString] as the *best* way to coerce values to strings. I think that carries a lot of weight, in terms of him supporting at least a subset of *implicit* coercion practices. His views on *implicit* coercion must be a bit more nuanced than, "it's all bad."

### To Number

Numeric coercions are a bit more complicated than string coercions, since we can be talking about either `number` or `bigint` as the target type. There's also a much smaller set of values that can be validly represented numerically (everything else becomes `NaN`).

Let's start with the `Number(..)` and `BigInt(..)` functions (no `new` keywords):

```js
Number("42");                   // 42
Number("-3.141596");            // -3.141596
Number("-0");                   // -0

BigInt("42");                   // 42n
BigInt("-0");                   // 0n
```

`Number` coercion which fails (not recognized) results in `NaN` (see "Invalid Number" in Chapter 1), whereas `BigInt` throws an exception:

```js
Number("123px");                // NaN

BigInt("123px");
// SyntaxError: Cannot convert 123px to a BigInt
```

Moreover, even though `42n` is valid syntax as a literal `bigint`, the string `"42n"` is never a recognized string representation of a `bigint`, by either of the coercive function forms:

```js
Number("42n");                  // NaN

BigInt("42n");
// SyntaxError: Cannot convert 42n to a BigInt
```

However, we *can* coerce numeric strings with other representations of the numbers than typical base-10 decimals (see Chapter 1 for more information):

```js
Number("0b101010");             // 42

BigInt("0b101010");             // 42n
```

Typically, `Number(..)` and `BigInt(..)` receive string values, but that's not actually required. For example, `true` and `false` coerce to their typical numeric equivalents:

```js
Number(true);                   // 1
Number(false);                  // 0

BigInt(true);                   // 1n
BigInt(false);                  // 0n
```

You can also generally coerce between `number` and `bigint` types:

```js
Number(42n);                    // 42
Number(42n ** 1000n);           // Infinity

BigInt(42);                     // 42n
```

We can also use the `+` unary operator, which is commonly assumed to coerce the same as the `Number(..)` function:

```js
+"42";                          // 42
+"0b101010";                    // 42
```

Be careful though. If the coercions are unsafe/invalid in certain ways, exceptions are thrown:

```js
BigInt(3.141596);
// RangeError: The number 3.141596 cannot be converted to a BigInt

+42n;
// TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number
```

Clearly, `3.141596` does not safely coerce to an integer, let alone a `bigint`.

But `+42n` throwing an exception is an interesting case. By contrast, `Number(42n)` works fine, so it's a bit surprising that `+42n` fails.

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| That surprise is especially palpable since prepending a `+` in front of a number is typically assumed to just mean a "positive number", the same way `-` in front a number is assumed to mean a "negative number". As explained in Chapter 1, however, JS numeric syntax (`number` and `bigint`) recognize no syntax for "negative values". All numeric literals are parsed as "positive" by default. If a `+` or `-` is prepended, those are treated as unary operators applied against the parsed (positive) number. |

OK, so `+42n` is parsed as `+(42n)`. But still... why is `+` throwing an exception here?

You might recall earlier when we showed that JS allows *explicit* string coercion of symbol values, but disallows *implicit* string coercions? The same thing is going on here. JS language design interprets unary `+` in front of a `bigint` value as an *implicit* `ToNumber()` coercion (thus disallowed!), but `Number(..)` is interpreted as an *explicit* `ToNumber()` coercion (thus allowed!).

In other words, contrary to popular assumption/assertion, `Number(..)` and `+` are not interchangable. I think `Number(..)` is the safer/more reliable form.

Like string coercions, if you perform a numeric coercion on a non-primitive object value, the `ToPrimitive()` operation is activated to first turn it into some primitive value

### To Primitive

Most operators in JS, including those we've see with coercions to `string` and `number`, are designed to run against primitive values. When any of these operators is used instead against an object value, the abstract `ToPrimitive` algorithm (as described earlier) is activated to coerce the object to a primitive.

Let's set up an object we can use to inspect how different operations behave:

```js
spyObject = {
    toString() {
        console.log("toString() invoked!");
        return "10";
    },
    valueOf() {
        console.log("valueOf() invoked!");
        return 42;
    },
};
```

This object defines both the `toString()` and `valueOf()` methods, and each one returns a different type of value (`string` vs `number`).

Let's try some of the coercion operations we've already seen:

```js
String(spyObject);
// toString() invoked!
// "10"

spyObject + "";
// valueOf() invoked!
// "42"
```

Whoa! I bet that surprised a few of you readers; it certainly did me. It's so common for people to assert that `String(..)` and `+ ""` are equivalent forms of activating the `ToString()` operation. But they're clearly not!

The difference comes down to the *hint* that each operation provides to `ToPrimitive()`. `String(..)` clearly provides `"string"` as the *hint*, whereas the `+ ""` idiom provides no *hint* (similar to *hinting* `"number"`). But don't miss this detail: even though `+ ""` invokes `valueOf()`, when that returns a `number` primitive value of `42`, that value is then coerced to a string (via `ToString()`), so we get `"42"` instead of `42`.

Let's keep going:

```js
Number(spyObject);
// valueOf() invoked!
// 42

+spyObject;
// valueOf() invoked!
// 42
```

This example implies that `Number(..)` and the unary `+` operator both perform the same `ToPrimitive()` coercion (with *hint* of `"number"`), which in our case returns `42`. Since that's already a `number` as requested, the value comes out without further ado.

But what if a `valueOf()` returns a `bigint`?

```js
spyObject2 = {
    valueOf() {
        console.log("valueOf() invoked!");
        return 42n;  // bigint!
    }
};

Number(spyObject2);
// valueOf() invoked!
// 42     <--- look, not a bigint!

+spyObject2;
// valueOf() invoked!
// TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number
```

We saw this difference earlier in the "To Number" section. JS allows an *explicit* coercion of the `42n` bigint value to the `42` number value, but it disallows what it considers to be an *implicit* coercion form.

What about the `BigInt(..)` (no `new` keyword) coercion function?

```js
BigInt(spyObject);
// valueOf() invoked!
// 42n    <--- look, a bigint!

BigInt(spyObject2);
// valueOf() invoked!
// 42n

// *******************************

spyObject3 = {
    valueOf() {
        console.log("valueOf() invoked!");
        return 42.3;
    }
};

BigInt(spyObject3);
// valueOf() invoked!
// RangeError: The number 42.3 cannot be converted to a BigInt
```

Again, as we saw in the "To Number" section, `42` can safely be coerced to `42n`. On the other hand, `42.3` cannot safely be coerced to a `bigint`.

We've seen that `toString()` and `valueOf()` are invoked, variously, as certain `string` and `number` / `bigint` coercions are performed.

#### No Primitive Found?

If `ToPrimitive()` fails to produce a primitive value, an exception will be thrown:

```js
spyObject4 = {
    toString() {
        console.log("toString() invoked!");
        return [];
    },
    valueOf() {
        console.log("valueOf() invoked!");
        return {};
    }
};

String(spyObject4);
// toString() invoked!
// valueOf() invoked!
// TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value

Number(spyObject4);
// valueOf() invoked!
// toString() invoked!
// TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value
```

If you're going to define custom to-primitive coercions via `toString()` / `valueOf()`, make sure to return a primitive from at least one of them!

#### Object To Boolean

What about `boolean` coercions of objects?

```js
Boolean(spyObject);
// true

!spyObject;
// false

if (spyObject) {
    console.log("if!");
}
// if!

result = spyObject ? "ternary!" : "nope";
// "ternary!"

while (spyObject) {
    console.log("while!");
    break;
}
// while!
```

Each of these are activating `ToBoolean()`. But if you recall from earlier, *that* algorithm never delegates to `ToPrimitive()`; thus, we don't see "valueOf() invoked!" being logged out.

#### Unboxing: Wrapper To Primitive

A special form of objects that are often `ToPrimitive()` coerced: boxed/wrapped primitives (as seen in Chapter 3). This particular object-to-primitive coercion is often referred to as *unboxing*.

Consider:

```js
hello = new String("hello");
String(hello);                  // "hello"
hello + "";                     // "hello"

fortyOne = new Number(41);
Number(fortyOne);               // 41
fortyOne + 1;                   // 42
```

The object wrappers `hello` and `fortyOne` above have `toString()` and `valueOf()` methods configured on them, to behave similarly to the `spyObject` / etc objects from our previous examples.

A special case to be careful of with wrapped-object primitives is with `Boolean()`:

```js
nope = new Boolean(false);
Boolean(nope);                  // true   <--- oops!
!!nope;                         // true   <--- oops!
```

Remember, this is because `ToBoolean()` does *not* reduce an object to its primitive form with `ToPrimitive`; it merely looks up the value in its internal table, and since normal (non-exotic[^ExoticFalsyObjects]) objects are always truthy, `true` comes out.

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| It's a nasty little gotcha. A case could certainly be made that `new Boolean(false)` should configure itself internally as an exotic "falsy object". [^ExoticFalsyObjects] Unfortunately, that change now, 25 years into JS's history, could easily create breakage in programs. As such, JS has left this gotcha untouched. |

#### Overriding Default `toString()`

As we've seen, you can always define a `toString()` on an object to have *it* invoked by the appropriate `ToPrimitive()` coercion. But another option is to override the `Symbol.toStringTag`:

```js
spyObject5a = {};
String(spyObject5a);
// "[object Object]"
spyObject5a.toString();
// "[object Object]"

spyObject5b = {
    [Symbol.toStringTag]: "my-spy-object"
};
String(spyObject5b);
// "[object my-spy-object]"
spyObject5b.toString();
// "[object my-spy-object]"

spyObject5c = {
    get [Symbol.toStringTag]() {
        return `myValue:${this.myValue}`;
    },
    myValue: 42
};
String(spyObject5c);
// "[object myValue:42]"
spyObject5c.toString();
// "[object myValue:42]"
```

`Symbol.toStringTag` is intended to define a custom string value to describe the object whenever its default `toString()` operation is invoked directly, or implicitly via coercion; in its absence, the value used is `"Object"` in the common `"[object Object]"` output.

The `get ..` syntax in `spyObject5c` is defining a *getter*. That means when JS tries to access this `Symbol.toStringTag` as a property (as normal), this gettter code instead causes the function we specify to be invoked to compute the result. We can run any arbitrary logic inside this getter to dynamically determine a string *tag* for use by the default `toString()` method.

#### Overriding `ToPrimitive`

You can alternately override the whole default `ToPrimitive()` operation for any object, by setting the special symbol property `Symbol.toPrimitive` to hold a function:

```js
spyObject6 = {
    [Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) {
        console.log(`toPrimitive(${hint}) invoked!`);
        return 25;
    },
    toString() {
        console.log("toString() invoked!");
        return "10";
    },
    valueOf() {
        console.log("valueOf() invoked!");
        return 42;
    },
};

String(spyObject6);
// toPrimitive(string) invoked!
// "25"   <--- not "10"

spyObject6 + "";
// toPrimitive(default) invoked!
// "25"   <--- not "42"

Number(spyObject6);
// toPrimitive(number) invoked!
// 25     <--- not 42 or "25"

+spyObject6;
// toPrimitive(number) invoked!
// 25
```

As you can see, if you define this function on an object, it's used entirely in replacement of the default `ToPrimitive()` abstract operation. Since `hint` is still provided to this invoked function (`[Symbol.toPrimitive](..)`), you could in theory implement your own version of the algorithm, invoking a `toString()`, `valueOf()`, or any other method on the object (`this` context reference).

Or you can just manually define a return value as shown above. Regardless, JS will *not* automatically invoke either `toString()` or `valueOf()` methods.

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| As discussed prior in "No Primitive Found?", if the defined `Symbol.toPrimitive` function does not actually return a value that's a primitive, an exception will be thrown about being unable to "...convert object to primitive value". Make sure to always return an actual primitive value from such a function! |

### Equality

Thus far, the coercions we've seen have been focused on single values. We turn out attention now to equality comparisons, which inherently involve two values, either or both of which may be subject to coercion.

Earlier in this chapter, we talked about several abstract operations for value equality comparison.

For example, the `SameValue()` operation[^SameValue] is the strictest of the equality comparisons, with absolutely no coercion. The most obvious JS operation that relies on `SameValue()` is:

```js
Object.is(42,42);                   // true
Object.is(-0,-0);                   // true
Object.is(NaN,NaN);                 // true

Object.is(0,-0);                    // false
```

The `SameValueZero()` operation -- recall, it only differs from `SameValue()` by treating `-0` and `0` as indistinguishable -- is used in quite a few more places, including:

```js
[ 1, 2, NaN ].includes(NaN);        // true
```

We can see the `0` / `-0` misdirection of `SameValueZero()` here:

```js
[ 1, 2, -0 ].includes(0);           // true  <--- oops!

(new Set([ 1, 2, 0 ])).has(-0);     // true  <--- ugh

(new Map([[ 0, "ok" ]])).has(-0);   // true  <--- :(
```

In these cases, there's a *coercion* (of sorts!) that treats `-0` and `0` as indistinguishable. No, that's not technically a "coercion" in that the type is not being changed, but I'm sort of fudging the definition to *include* this case in our broader discussion of coercion here.

Contrast the `includes()` / `has()` methods here, which activate `SameValueZero()`, with the good ol' `indexOf(..)` array utility, which instead activates `IsStrictlyEqual()` instead. This algorithm is slightly more "coercive" than `SameValueZero()`, in that it prevents `NaN` values from ever being treated as equal to each other:

```js
[ 1, 2, NaN ].indexOf(NaN);         // -1  <--- not found
```

If these nuanced quirks of `includes(..)` and `indexOf(..)` bother you, when searching -- looking for an equality match within -- for a value in an array, you can avoid any "coercive" quicks and *force* the strictest `SameValue()` equality matching, via `Object.is(..)`:

```js
vals = [ 0, 1, 2, -0, NaN ];

vals.find(v => Object.is(v,-0));            // -0
vals.find(v => Object.is(v,NaN));           // NaN

vals.findIndex(v => Object.is(v,-0));       // 3
vals.findIndex(v => Object.is(v,NaN));      // 4
```

#### Equality Operators: `==` vs `===`

The most obvious place where *coercion* is involved in equality checks is with the `==` operator. Despite any pre-conceived notions you may have about `==`, it behaves extremely predictably, ensuring that both operands match types before performing its equality check.

Recall and review the steps discussed earlier in the chapter for the `IsLooselyEqual()` operation. [^LooseEquality] Its behavior, and thus how `==` acts, can be pragmatically intuited with just these two facts in mind:

1. If the types of both operands are the same, `==` has the exact same behavior as `===` -- `IsLooselyEqual()` immediately delegates to `IsStrictlyEqual()`. [^StrictEquality]

    For example, when both operands are object references:

    ```js
    myObj = { a: 1 };
    anotherObj = myObj;

    myObj == anotherObj;                // true
    myObj === anotherObj;               // true
    ```

    Here, `==` and `===` determine that both of their respective operands are of the `object` reference type, so both equality checks behave identically; they compare the object references for equality.

2. But if the operand types differ, `==` allows coercion until they match, and prefers numeric comparison; it attempts to coerce both operands to numbers, if possible:

    ```js
    42 == "42";                         // true
    ```

    Here, the `"42"` string is coerced to a `42` number (not vice versa), and thus the comparison is then `42 == 42`, and must clearly return `true`.


Armed with this knowledge, we'll now dispell the common myth that only `===` checks the type and value, while `==` checks only the value. Not true!

In fact, `==` and `===` are both type-sensitive, each checking the types of their operands. The `==` operator allows coercion of mismatched types, whereas `===` disallows any coercion.

It's a nearly universally held opinion that `==` should be avoided in favor of `===`. I may be one of the only developers who publicly advocates a clear and straight-faced case for the opposite. I think the main reason people instead prefer `===`, beyond simply conforming to the status quo, is a lack of taking the time to actually understand `==`.

I'll be revisiting this topic to make the case for preferring `==` over `===`, later in this chapter. All I ask is, no matter how strongly you currently disagree with me, try to keep an open mindset.

#### Nullish Coercion

We've already seen a number of JS operations that are nullish -- treating `null` and `undefined` as coercively equal to each other, including the `?.` optional-chaining operator and the `??` nullish-coalescing operator (see "Null'ish" in Chapter 1).

But `==` is the most obvious place that JS exposes nullish coercive equality:

```js
null == undefined;              // true
```

Neither `null` nor `undefined` will ever be coercively equal to any other value in the language, other than to each other. That means `==` makes it ergonomic to treat these two values as indistinguishable.

You might take advantage of this capability as such:

```js
if (someData == null) {
    // `someData` is "unset" (either null or undefined),
    // so set it to some default value
}

// OR:

if (someData != null) {
    // `someData` is set (neither null nor undefined),
    // so use it somehow
}
```

Remember that `!=` is the negation of `==`, whereas `!==` is the negation of `===`. Don't match the count of `=`s unless you want to confuse yourself!

Compare these two approaches:

```js
if (someData == null) {
    // ..
}

// vs:

if (someData === null || someData === undefined) {
    // ..
}
```

Both `if` statements will behave exactly identically. Which one would you rather write, and which one would you rather read later?

To be fair, some of you prefer the more verbose `===` equivalent. And that's OK. I disagree, I think the `==` version of this check is *much* better. And I also maintain that the `==` version is more consistent in stylistic spirit with how the other nullish operators like `?.` and `??` act.

But another minor fact you might consider: in performance benchmarks I've run many times, JS engines can perform the single `== null` check as shown *slightly faster* than the combination of two `===` checks. In other words, there's a tiny but measurable benefit to letting JS's `==` perform the *implicit* nullish coercion than in trying to *explicitly* list out both checks yourself.

I'd observe that even many diehard `===` fans tend to concede that `== null` is at least one such case where `==` is preferable.

## Coercion Corner Cases

I've been clear in expressing my pro-coercion opinion thus far. And it *is* just an opinion, though it's based on interpreting facts gleaned from studying the language specification and observable JS behaviors.

That's not to say that coercion is perfect. There's several frustrating corner cases we need to be aware of, so we avoid tripping into those potholes. In case it's not clear, my following characterizations of these corner cases are just more of my opinions. Your mileage may vary.

### Strings

We already saw that the string coercion of an array looks like this:

```js
String([ 1, 2, 3 ]);                // "1,2,3"
```

I personally find that super annoying, that it doesn't include the surrounding `[ ]`. In particular, that leads to this absurdity:

```js
String([]);                         // ""
```

So we can't tell that it's even an array, because all we get is an empty string? Great, JS. That's just stupid. Sorry, but it is. And it gets worse:

```js
String([ null, undefined ]);        // ","
```

WAT!? We know that `null` coerces to the string `"null"`, and `undefined` coerces to the string `"undefined"`. But if those values are in an array, they magically just *disappear* as empty strings in the array-to-string coercion. Only the `","` remains to even hint to us there was anything at all in the array! That's just silly town, right there.

What about objects? Almost as aggravating, though in the opposite direction:

```js
String({});                         // "[object Object]"

String({ a: 1 });                   // "[object Object]"
```

Umm... OK. Sure, thanks JS for no help at all in understanding what the object value is.

### Numbers

I'm about to reveal what I think is *the* worst root of all coercion corner case evil. Are you ready for it?!?

```js
Number("");                         // 0
Number("       ");                  // 0
```

I'm still shaking my head at this one, and I've known about it for nearly 20 years. I still don't get what Brendan was thinking with this one.

The empty string is devoid of any contents; it has nothing in it with which to determine a numeric representation. `0` is absolutely ***NOT*** the numeric equivalent of missing/invalid numeric value. You know what number value we have that is well-suited to communicate that? `NaN`. Don't even get me started on how whitespace is stripped from strings when coercing to a number, so the very-much-not-empty `"       "` string is still treated the same as `""` for numeric coercion purposes.

This is absurd, upside-down universe territory.

Much more tame, but still mildly annoying:

```js
Number("NaN");                      // NaN  <--- accidental!

Number("Infinity");                 // Infinity
Number("infinity");                 // NaN  <--- oops, watch case!
```

The string `"NaN"` is not parsed as a recognizable numeric value, so the coercion fails, producing (accidentally!) the `NaN` value. `"Infinity"` is explicitly parseable for the coercion, but any other casing, including `"infinity"`, will fail, again producing `NaN`.
